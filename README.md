# ABOUT ME

I'm originally from a hospitality background but now exploring the exciting world of IT as a self-taught web developer. What began as a hobby has evolved into a passion, and I'm eager to transition my career into this dynamic field.

I've dived into HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I'm always itching to deepen my knowledge and skills. Building user-friendly websites and cracking coding puzzles bring me immense satisfaction.

Let's connect, collaborate, and create some amazing digital experiences together!

CheersðŸ˜„
